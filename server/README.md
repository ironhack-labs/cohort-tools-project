# API Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the available routes and data models for the Cohort Tools API.

Throughout the project, you should use this documentation as a reference and a guide. Refer to it whenever you need information or more details on how to implement the routes or model your database.

## Routes

In this section, you will find detailed information about the different routes available in the API.
The API offers a variety of routes to work with *cohort* and *student* documents. Each route is associated with a specific HTTP verb and URL, allowing you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) actions on the data.
